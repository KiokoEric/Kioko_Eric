            FirstText='I discovered a love for web development 2 years ago when I enrolled in a 2 week Javascript boot camp. I was greatly captivated by the idea presented by the teachers who highlighted all the possibilities that could be achieved through web development. After the boot camp, I began a self-taught web development journey which saw me progress through tutorials, books and mentorship. In these 2 years, I have developed myself as a full-stack software developer with real-world projects. I am excited to venture into a career as a full-stack developer where I can contribute to enhancing a userâ€™s web experience.'
